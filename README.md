# Creating Tasks using FreeRTOS in Arduino UNO

In this project, we maked the LCD blink changing the LCD color from black to white with a frequency of 1000ms in black and with a frequency of 3000ms in white. In addition, the name of the corresponding task will be printed on the serial display within of IDE and, at a frequency of 5000ms, print the value of the counter that will increase with each print.
