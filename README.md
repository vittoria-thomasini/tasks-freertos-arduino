# Creating Tasks using FreeRTOS in Arduino UNO
<h2>How it works?</h2>
In this project, we maked the LCD blink changing the LCD color from black to white with a frequency of 1000ms in black and with a frequency of 3000ms in white. In addition, the name of the corresponding task will be printed on the serial display within of IDE and, at a frequency of 5000ms, print the value of the counter that will increase with each print.

<h2>Environment</h2>
- Microcontrolador Arduino Uno <br>
- Display LCD Tft de 2.4 Touch Screen <br>
- Cabo USB<br>
- Arduino IDE vers√£o 1.8.16<br>
- Biblioteca FreeRTOS<br>
